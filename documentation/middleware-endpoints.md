# Middleware Endpoints (as of 2023-2-22)

## Wallet interaction endpoints:

These endpoints facilitate interaction with the user's wallet.

---

### Endpoint `userWalletLogin`:

```ts
async function userWalletLogin(loginType: string, preferBatchedMode: boolean = false): Promise<Wallet | FailedResult>;
```

Attempts to log into the specified wallet. If the userâ€™s wallet has previously authorized connecting to the game, the endpoint will instantly return the wallet information. If not, the connection is attempted, which may result in a pop-up window which the user will have to confirm authorizing connecting their wallet to the game before the data is returned.

The first parameter, `loginType`, is a string specifying which wallet should be used. Case is ignored (the string is converted to lowercase before processing). Only the following values are currently supported:

- `"metamask"`
- `"evm-flint"`
- `"flint"`
- `"nufi"`
- `"nami"`
- `"eternl"`
- `"polkadot"`

The first parameter, `preferBatchedMode`, can be ommitted. If truthy value is provided, then even EVM wallets (`metamask` & `evm-flint` currently) will use `BATCHED` posting mode.

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "walletAddress": "0x186...a40"
  }
}
```

---

## Read endpoints:

---

### Endpoint `getLatestProcessedBlockHeight`:

```ts
async function getLatestProcessedBlockHeight(): Promise<SuccessfulResult<number> | FailedResult>;
```

Returns the latest block height that the game state machine has processed.

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": 5708628
}
```

---

### Endpoint `getUserLobbiesMatches`:

```ts
async function getUserLobbiesMatches(
  walletAddress: string,
  page: number,
  count?: number
): Promise<LobbyStates | FailedResult>;
```

Returns a list of lobbies the specified user is in.

This endpoint is paginated, meaning that the `page` argument can be used to request different pages, and the optional `count` argument can specify the number of lobbies returned in each call.

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "lobbies": [
    {
      "lobby_id": "zisC9B75VPZ4",    // 12 characters

async function getUserFinishedLobbies(
  wallet: string,
  page: number,
  count?: number
): Promise<LobbyStates | FailedResult>;
```

Returns a list of lobbies the specified user played in.

async function getOpenLobbies(
  wallet: string,
  page: number,
  count?: number
): Promise<LobbyStates | FailedResult>;
```

Returns a list of open lobbies, that the user can join. Lobbies created by `wallet` are filtered out.

This endpoint is paginated, meaning that the `page` argument can be used to request different pages, and the optional `count` argument can specify the number of lobbies returned in each call.

As requested this endpoint adds a query for the user stats of the lobby creator.

#### Example Output:

```

---

### Endpoint `getRandomOpenLobby`:

## Write endpoints:

These endpoints are used to post data to the blockchain. Each of them triggers a transaction which the user must confirm. As a result, all of these require the user to be logged in using the `userWalletLogin` endpoint.

---

### Endpoint `createLobby`:

Asks the user to sign a transaction which allows them to create a new lobby, requiring the specification of various match settings.

```ts
async function createLobby(arg: string): Promise<LobbyResponse | FailedResult>;
```

The argument of this function is a JSON string, which when unpacked looks like:

```ts
{
  "configName": string,         // 14 character string. Default is "defaultdefault"
  "creatorRole": "attacker" | "defender" | "random",  // role of the lobby creator
  "numberOfRounds": number,     // must be a positive whole number
  "roundLength": number,        // must be a positive whole number
  "mapName": string,
  "isHidden" = false: boolean   // false by default
  "isPractice" = false: boolean // false by default
  "hasAutoplay" = true: boolean // true by default
}
```

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "lobbyID": "WWBV9FWI3LS4",
  "lobbyStatus": "open",
  "success": true
}
```

---

### Endpoint `joinLobby`:

Asks the user to sign a transaction which allows them to join the given lobby.

```ts
async function joinLobby(lobbyID: string): Promise<Result>;
```

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": ""
}
```

---

### Endpoint `closeLobby`:

Asks the user to sign a transaction which allows them to close the given lobby.

```ts
async function closeLobby(lobbyID: string): Promise<Result>;
```

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": ""
}
```

---

### Endpoint `submitMoves`:

Asks the user to sign a transaction which submits 3 moves in the latest round of a actively running match. The user can only submit their moves once per round, and cannot revert their actions once submitted. The parameter `moves` has to be an array of exactly 3 objects.

```ts
async function submitMoves(arg: string): Promise<Result>;
```

The argument to this function is a JSON string which when unpacked looks like:

```ts
{
  "lobbyID": string,
  "roundNumber": number,   // must be a positive whole number; round 0 means the match has not started yet so moves with round number 0 are invalid
  "moves": TurnAction[]
}
```

The `moves` list must be a list of objects of one of the following four forms:

```ts
{
    "action": "build",
    "round": number,
    "coordinates": number,      // index of the map array
    "faction": "attacker" | "defender",
    "structure": "anacondaTower" | "gorillaCrypt" | ... // name of the structure
}
```

```ts
{
    "action": "repair",
    "round": number,
    "faction": "attacker" | "defender",
    "id": number // number of the structure ID
}
```

```ts
{
    "action": "upgrade",
    "round": number,
    "faction": "attacker" | "defender",
    "id": number // number of the structure ID
}
```

```ts
{
    "action": "salvage",
    "round": number,
    "faction": "attacker" | "defender",
    "id": number // number of the structure ID
}
```

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": ""
}
```

---

### Endpoint `setNft`:

Asks the user to sign a transaction which registers the specified NFT to their address as the one they want to use in matches. Their ownership of the NFT is not verified at this stage. The registered NFT can later be retrieved using the `getUserSetNFT` endpoint.

```ts
async function setNft(nftAddress: string, nftId: number): Promise<Result>;
```

#### Example Output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": ""
}
```

---

## Utility endpoints:

These are regular functions that don't need any external calls or async treatment. They can be utilized from Unity as unified access to some of the middleware's own functionality. The initial purpose is a custom logger.

---

### Endpoint `log`:

A wrapper around `console.log` function with the same interface. Converts arrays, objects, JS errors and primitive values to strings and appends them to in memory logs buffer. Formatting includes timestamp before the message. Currently limited to 1000 entries (the oldest are automatically deleted).

```ts
function log(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void;
```

---

### Endpoint `exportLogs`:

Concatenates the log buffer into a single string meant for further export. File with this string as a content is created in `paimaBridge.jslib` on Unity's side where all of our endpoints are consumed.

```ts
function exportLogs(nftAddress: string, nftId: number): string;
```
